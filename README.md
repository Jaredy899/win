# Jared's Windows Installs

The script starts with asking if you want to update Windows, then if you want to do certain setup items including allowing Remote Desktop, allowing SSH, and configuring time settings. Then the script asks if you want to install mypowershell, which is based on ChrisTitusTech's mybash. Finally it asks if you want to open ChrisTitusTech's WinUtil for additional applications and tweaks.
